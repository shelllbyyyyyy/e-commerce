# E-Commerce Microservices Application

This project is an e-commerce application built using a microservices architecture with NestJS, RabbitMQ, Prisma, and PostgreSQL. The system is designed to be scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily maintainable, leveraging CQRS and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.

### Note

- This is just my hobbies not recommended for production
- Just learning from youtube
- Sorry if the code is "amburadul" ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
- This is prove that people like me can make this kind of shit ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥, even i don't have an it degree . So please hire me ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

## **Features**

- **Microservices Architecture**: Modular services for authentication, products, orders, and more.
- **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ for asynchronous communication between services.
- **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests, with load balancing capabilities.
- **Scalable**: Horizontal scaling of services with Docker.
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Managed using Prisma ORM.
- **Secure**: JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.

## **Architecture**

The application consists of multiple microservices:

- **API Gateway**: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate service.
- **Auth Service**: Manages user registration, login, and authentication.
- **Product Service**: Handles product management, including CRUD operations.
- **Order Service**: Manages orders and inventory status.
- **Cart Service**: Manages cart.
- **User Service**: Manages users and profiles.
- **Billing Service**: Manages billing and payment gateways.
- **RabbitMQ**: Facilitates communication between services.
- **PostgreSQL**: Stores all application data.

## **Technology Stack**

- **NestJS**: Backend framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.
- **RabbitMQ**: Message broker for communication between microservices.
- **Prisma**: ORM for managing PostgreSQL databases.
- **PostgreSQL**: Relational database for storing data.
- **Docker**: Containerization of services for easy deployment and scaling.
- **Cloudinary**: Storage for store images such as product-images, profile-pictures , etc.
- **Midtrans**: as Payment gateways.

## **Getting Started**

### **Prerequisites**

- Node.js v16 or later
- Docker and Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL

### **Environment Variables**

Configure your environment variables in the `.env` files located in the root and each microservice directory.

```

### **Installation**

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shelllbyyyyyy/e-commerce.git

cd e-commerce
```

## **Running the Application**

Start Services: Use Docker Compose to start all services.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Access the API Gateway: The gateway will be available at http://localhost:4000.

## **Usage**

Register a User: Use the /api/auth/register endpoint via the gateway to register new users.
Login: Authenticate using the /api/auth/login endpoint.
Manage Products: Use the /api/products endpoints to manage product data.

## **API Documentation**

The Swagger documentation for the API can be accessed at:

Gateway Swagger: http://localhost:4000/api/docs

## **Deployment**

Build Docker Images:

- For development:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

- Deploy to Production:

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```
